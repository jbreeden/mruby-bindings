- (Maybe?) Throw exception, not StandardError, when int->mrb_int conversions fails (due to bounds check). The user shouldn't be catching these
- How the hell does ruby-ffi generate c functions & funtion pointers? (Oh... trampolining, and it's complicated...)
- (Maybe?) instead of unboxing, just use mrb_get_args specifiers for simple types like int & bool
- boxing functions should use class retrieving macros
