/**
 * NOTE: Unlike most other generated files,

 *       This means you're free to make modifications of your own.
 *
 *       It also means that any changes to the genenerate code
 *       must be merged in manually (but this is rare, only occurring
 *       when a new version of mruby-bindings is used). In that case,
 *       just diff your file with its generated version in the
 *       mruby-bindings.out/mrbgem/src/ directory.
